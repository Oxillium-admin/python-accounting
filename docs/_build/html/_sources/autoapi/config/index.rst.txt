.. py:module:: config

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   This module provides the configuration for python accounting. Its properties are populated from the
   config.toml by default and should be adequate for most settings (except maybe the datatabse
   configuration), but being a plain python object any of the attributes may be overriden by
   assingment at any point. For more extensive custom configurations, you can initialize the
   class with a custom config.tml file.
